Visualize

Visualize enables you to create visualizations of the data from your Elasticsearch indices, Which you can then add to dashboards for analysis. Kibana visualizations are based on Elasticsearch queries. By using a series of Elasticsearch aggreagations to extract and process your data, you can create charts that show you the trends, spikes, and dips you need to  know about.

To begin, open the menu, go to visualize, then click Create visualzation.
